&{template:default} {{name=Prismatic Wall }} {{Near=  If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a DC @{selected|spell_save_dc} Constitution saving throw or become Blinded for 1 minute.}} {{ Desc= The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers.  As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a DC @{selected|spell_save_dc} Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s Properties as described below.}} {{Red= [[10d6]] fire, save for half}} {{Orange= [[10d6]] acid, save for half}} {{Yellow= [[10d6]] lightning, save for half}} {{Green= [[10d6]] poison, save for half}} {{Blue= [[10d6]] cold, save for half}} {{Indigo= On a failed save, the creature is Restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the Petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.}} {{Violet=  On a failed save, the creature is Blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM’s choosing and is no longer Blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)}}
